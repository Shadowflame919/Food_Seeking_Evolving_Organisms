# Food_Seeking_Evolving_Organisms

Organisms start with a random neural network brain which results in random movements.
They lose energy that currently depends on 4 factors:
  Time
  Current speed travelling
  Current turning speed
  Number of hidden neurons in brain (inputs and outputs remain the same)
  
Organisms use their brain structure to navigate throughout its 'environment' to collect food and has 3 eyes to sense nearby food.
Collecting food gives the organism energy which it can use to live and reproduce.
If an organism reaches 0 energy it is removed from the simulation.
  
When an organism reaches 100 energy it produces offspring and gives half its energy to it.
The offspring has a brain that is slightly different from its parent with a small chances (20%) to have an extra neuron.

Better brains structures for collecting food result in a higher chance to have children with simular brain structures the their and thus natural selection produces organisms who are quite good at collecting food.
